# Fresscards

This is my personal iOS app for learn and memorise foreign words using flashcards.
You can generate cards on any topic of interest to you.

It is a ChatGPT wrapper, basically and created just to learch SwiftUI. In the end, it was published to the Apple App store and had a in-app purschase. But not customers ðŸ˜ƒ 

Only Swift and SwiftUI used, without 3rd-party depencencies.
Also have a backend part written in Python FastAPI, mongoDB and Redis for prompts caching.
